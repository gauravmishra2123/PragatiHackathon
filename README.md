# Introduction
LabShala.ai is an open-source AI-powered platform designed to bring hands-on science learning to schools that lack access to physical laboratories. Built with a blend of interactive simulations, intelligent tutoring, and student performance analytics, it enables students to perform experiments, get guided support, and build real-world skills—all from a device.
Inspired by decades of grassroots experience in running schools, our mission is to make STEM education practical, accessible, and personalized for every learner, especially in underfunded regions.

# Problem Statement Addressed 
Many schools, especially in underfunded or rural areas, lack well-equipped science labs and trained educators. This leads to students missing out on essential practical learning and reduces their engagement with STEM fields. LabShala.ai directly tackles this by providing an AI-powered virtual lab solution, enabling hands-on learning through interactive simulations, intelligent tutoring, and performance monitoring, even without physical lab infrastructure.

# Solution 
We are building AI-powered virtual science labs to bring hands-on STEM education to every student —
regardless of their location or school resources.

# 🔬 What it is:
A fully digital, interactive platform where students can perform science experiments virtually, just like in
a physical lab.
# 🤖 How it works:
Students log in to a virtual lab space.
AI guides them step-by-step through experiments.
Instant feedback, explanations, and assessments make learning intuitive and fun.
