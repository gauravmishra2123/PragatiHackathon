# ðŸ”¬ GuruKul.ai â€“ Bridging the Lab Gap with AI
# Introduction
GuruKul.ai is an AI-powered educational platform designed to bring hands-on, practical science learning to students in under-resourced schools. Many schools lack access to functional labs, skilled educators, or even space to conduct experiments. GuruKul.ai solves this through immersive virtual labs, performance analytics, and interactive AI-driven tutoringâ€”accessible from any device.
Built with the vision of transforming education at scale, the project leverages:
ðŸ§ª Simulated Labs powered by platforms like PhET
ðŸ§  Open-source AI models for personalized learning support
ðŸ“Š Analytics dashboards for student performance monitoring
